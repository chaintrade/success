How it works

<h2>  Basic </h2>
Blockchain is a type of shared database that differs from a typical database in the way that it stores information;
blockchains store data in blocks that are then linked together via cryptography.
<br>
As new data comes in, it is entered into a fresh block. Once the block is filled with data, it is chained onto the previous block, which makes the data chained together in chronological order.
<br>
Different types of information can be stored on a blockchain, but the most common use so far has been as a ledger for transactions.
<br>
In Bitcoin’s case, blockchain is used in a decentralized way so that no single person or group has control—rather, all users collectively retain control.
<br>
Decentralized blockchains are immutable, which means that the data entered is irreversible. For Bitcoin, this means that transactions are permanently recorded and viewable to anyone.
<br>
<h2>How Does a Blockchain Work?</h2>
<br>
The goal of blockchain is to allow digital information to be recorded and distributed, but not edited. In this way, a blockchain is the foundation for immutable ledgers, or records of transactions that cannot be altered, deleted, or destroyed. This is why blockchains are also known as a distributed ledger technology (DLT).
<br>
First proposed as a research project in 1991, the blockchain concept predated its first widespread application in use: Bitcoin, in 2009. In the years since, the use of blockchains has exploded via the creation of various cryptocurrencies, decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and smart contracts.

<h2>What Is High-Frequency Trading (HFT)?</h2>
<br>
High-frequency trading, also known as HFT, is a method of trading that uses powerful computer programs to transact a large number of orders in fractions of a second. It uses complex algorithms to analyze multiple markets and execute orders based on market conditions. Typically, the traders with the fastest execution speeds are more profitable than traders with slower execution speeds.
<br>
In addition to the high speed of orders, HFT is also characterized by high turnover rates and order-to-trade ratios. Some of the best-known HFT firms include Tower Research, Citadel LLC, and Virtu Financial.
<br>
HFT is complex algorithmic trading in which large numbers of orders are executed within seconds.<br>
It adds liquidity to the markets and eliminates small bid-ask spreads.<br>
HFT is criticized for allowing large companies to gain an upper hand in trading.<br>
Another complaint is that the liquidity produced by this type of trading is momentary—it disappears within seconds, making it impossible for traders to take advantage of it.<br>
<h2>Benefits of High-Frequency Trading (HFT)</h2>
<br>
HFT has improved market liquidity and removed bid-ask spreads that previously would have been too small. This was tested by adding fees on HFT, which led bid-ask spreads to increase. One study assessed how Canadian bid-ask spreads changed when the government introduced fees on HFT. It found that market-wide bid-ask spreads increased by 13% and the retail spreads increased by 9%.

<h2>Trend trading</h2>

A trend trading strategy relies on using technical analysis to identify the direction of market momentum. This is usually considered a medium-term strategy, best suited to the trading styles of position traders or swing traders, as each position will remain open for as long as the trend continues.

The price of an asset can trend up or down. If you were going to take a long position, you’d do so when you believe the market is going to reach higher highs. If you were going to take a short position, you’d do so if you thought the market would reach lower lows.

Derivative and leveraged products – such as CFDs – are popular choices for trend-following strategies, because they enable traders to go both long and short. Here, you would put up a small initial deposit (called margin) to open a larger position. Note that leveraged trading is high risk and you could lose more than your initial deposit amount, because your total profit or loss is based on the total position size. Make sure you have adequate risk management steps in place.

Trend traders will use indicators throughout the trend to identify potential retracements, which are temporary moves against the prevailing trend. Trend traders will often take little notice of retracements, but it’s important to confirm it’s a temporary move rather than a complete reversal – which is often a signal to close a trade.
<h2>Range trading</h2>

Range trading is a strategy that seeks to take advantage of consolidating markets – the term to describe a market price that remains within lines of support and resistance. Range trading is popular among very short-term traders (known as scalpers), as it focusses on short-term profit taking, however it can be seen across all timeframes and styles.

While trend traders focus on the overall trend, range traders will focus on the short-term oscillations in price. They will open long positions when the price is moving between two clear levels and is not breaking above or below either.

This is a popular forex trading strategy, as many traders work off the idea that the very liquid currencies market remains in a tight trading range, with significant volatility in between these levels. This means that short-term traders can seek to take advantage of these fluctuations between known support and resistance levels.
<h2>Breakout trading</h2>

Breakout trading is the strategy of entering a given trend as early as possible, ready for the price to ‘break out’ of its range. Breakout trading is commonly used by day traders and swing traders, as it takes advantage of short to medium-term market movements.

Traders who use this strategy will look for price points that indicate the start of a period of volatility or a change in market sentiment – by entering the market at the correct level, these breakout traders can ride the movement from start to finish. It is common to place a limit-entry order around the levels of support or resistance, so that any breakout executes a trade automatically.

Most breakout trading strategies are based on volume levels, as the theory assumes that when volume levels start to increase, there will soon be a breakout from a support or resistance level. As such, popular indicators include the money flow index (MFI), on-balance volume and the volume-weighted moving average.
<h2>Reversal trading</h2>
The reversal trading strategy is based on identifying when a current trend is going to change direction. Once the reversal has happened, the strategy will take on a lot of the characteristics of a trend trading strategy – as it can last for varying amounts of time.

A reversal can occur in both directions, as it is simply a turning point in market sentiment. A ‘bullish reversal’ indicates that the market is at the bottom of a downtrend and will soon turn into an uptrend. While a ‘bearish reversal’ indicates that the market is at the top of an uptrend and will likely become a downtrend.

When trading reversals, it is important to make sure that the market is not simply retracing. The Fibonacci retracement is a common tool, used to confirm whether the market surpasses known retracement levels. It is worth noting that some consider Fibonacci retracements to be a self-fulfilling prophecy, as many orders will congregate around these levels and push the price in the desired direction.

It is important to combine technical indicators with other forms of analysis, whether this is other technical tools or fundamental analysis.
<h2>Gap trading</h2>
A gap occurs when where no trading activity has taken place. This happens when an asset’s price moves sharply high or low with nothing in between, implying the market has opened at a different price to its previous close.

If you’re a gap trader, you are likely a day trader that watches these price gaps from a previous day and seek opportunities between this and the opening range of trading for the next day. An opening range that rises above the previous day’s close is a ‘gap’ that usually signifies going long, while an opening range that is below the previous day’s close signifies an opportunity to go short.
<h2>Pairs trading</h2>
Pairs trading is finding the correlated pair of instruments where the valuation relationship has gone out of whack, buying under-priced instruments and the selling the overpriced ones. The aim is to make a profit irrespective of market conditions such as downtrends, uptrends and so on.
<h2>Arbitrage</h2>

Arbitrage is a transaction or a series of transactions in which you generate profit without taking any risk. An example of this would be spotting an opportunity in two equivalent assets where one is priced higher than the other and taking advantage of buying the lower priced one while it is still undervalued. There are few arbitrage opportunities because many traders may also be on the lookout and so they are often found quickly. In this case, the arbitrage edge disappears quickly as more traders flood the market to try and trade the opportunity.
<h2>Momentum</h2>

Momentum trading strategy is based on price trends and the direction they're taking. This happens where there is heavy price movement (or momentum) and traders are selling and buying assets for a period of time. Once there is a price change, the momentum changes in a different direction.
